Magento Module: Netzarbeiter/LoginCatalog
Author: Vinai Kopp <vinai@netzarbeiter.com>

This small extension requires a customer to be logged in order to view products or product collections.
If the customer navigates to a page that contains a product or a product collection, she will be
redirected to the account login page.

This Module was designed to work with the Module Netzarbeiter_CustomerActivation, which
only allows customers to log in after they have been activated in the adminhtml interface.
There also is the <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/635">Netzarbeiter_GroupsCatalog</a> extension which allows you to hide Categories
and/or groups depending on the customers groups. Installing this extension together with
the Customer Groups Catalog Extension will probably make no sense, so you have to decide
what suits your needs better.


The configuration for this module can be found in
System > Configuration > Catalog > Login only catalog

There you can disable the module on a global/website/store basis, and also choose to
hide the category navigation.
